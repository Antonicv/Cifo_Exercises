### 2. What is the dark side of agile?
 Is when agile principles are missunderstood or missaplied, leading to dysfunction instead improvement.

 **EXAMPLE**
  * Teams skip essentials elements like proper backlog = lack of documentation.

  * Organizations may adopt Agile as an excuse to cut costs or reduce headcount, rather than genuinely improve          processes. =  disillusionment among teams and compromises the quality of the product.

  * The push to always be Agile can lead to dogmatic adherence to frameworks, even when they are not the best fit. = Agile becomes a constraint rather than a tool, reducing efficiency and innovation.
 **how to avoid the Dark side of Agile**

 * Focus on Principles Over Rituals: Ensure teams understand the "why" behind Agile practices.

 * Promote a Healthy Culture: Foster collaboration, trust, and psychological safety.

 * Invest in Training: Equip teams and leaders with the knowledge to apply Agile effectively.

 * Prioritize Quality: Balance speed with technical excellence and long-term vision.

 * Tailor Agile to the Context: Adapt Agile practices to fit the team's and organization's unique needs, avoiding dogmatism.
