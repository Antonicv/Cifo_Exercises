# Ejercicio SCRUM 10/01/2025

### 1. What are the triggers for people to force change? 
 
 * Cue:
    (The Trigger for Change)
    Is a signal that something needs to change. EXAMPLES: Costumer complains/ Missed Deadlines / Technical Debt
 * Craving:
    (The Motivation to Change)
    Is the desire for achive a better outcome or avoid a negative one. EXAMPLES: Dessire for efficiency/ dessire for improve product
 * Response:
    (The Action to Address the Trigger)
    The response is the behavior or change implemented to satisf the carving. EXAMPLES: Sprint Retrospective Adjustments: After realizing stand-ups are inefficient, the Scrum Master introduces timeboxing for better focus

 * Reward:
    (The Outcome Of the Change)
    The reward is the benefit or relief gained from the change, reinforcing the behavior.EXAMPLES: On-Time Delivery/Happier Customers

**EXAMPLE WITH ALL CICLE:**
Situation: Sprint Goals Are Often Missed

1. Cue: Stakeholders express frustration that features are not delivered as planned.
2. Craving: The team desires to avoid stakeholder disappointment and improve predictability.
3. Response: They improve backlog refinement, define smaller user stories, and adjust their velocity expectations.
4. Reward: Stakeholders are happier with realistic forecasts, and the team feels more confident in their progress.

### 2. What is the dark side of agile?
![dark side](https://media.tenor.com/Y29XieO3ITkAAAAM/kermit-curse.gif)

 Is when agile principles are missunderstood or missaplied, leading to dysfunction instead improvement.

 **EXAMPLE**
  * Teams skip essentials elements like proper backlog = lack of documentation.

  * Organizations may adopt Agile as an excuse to cut costs or reduce headcount, rather than genuinely improve          processes. =  disillusionment among teams and compromises the quality of the product.

  * The push to always be Agile can lead to dogmatic adherence to frameworks, even when they are not the best fit. = Agile becomes a constraint rather than a tool, reducing efficiency and innovation.

 **how to avoid the Dark side of Agile**

 * Focus on Principles Over Rituals: Ensure teams understand the "why" behind Agile practices.

 * Promote a Healthy Culture: Foster collaboration, trust, and psychological safety.

 * Invest in Training: Equip teams and leaders with the knowledge to apply Agile effectively.

 * Prioritize Quality: Balance speed with technical excellence and long-term vision.

 * Tailor Agile to the Context: Adapt Agile practices to fit the team's and organization's unique needs, avoiding dogmatism.

 ### 2.b Dark side of user stories


 Ambiguity in Details

    Problem: User stories are intentionally brief and may lack sufficient detail for developers.
    Impact: This can lead to misunderstandings or incorrect assumptions about requirements, resulting in rework.

Dependency on Communication

    Problem: User stories require extensive communication between the Product Owner, the development team, and stakeholders to clarify details.
    Impact: If communication is ineffective, errors in implementation may occur.

Difficulty Managing Complexity

    Problem: User stories are designed to be small and manageable, but when a task is complex or technical (such as migrations or infrastructure tasks), it can be difficult to translate it into a user story.
    Impact: This can lead to forced or disconnected stories that fail to deliver user value.

Exclusive Focus on User Value

    Problem: User stories focus on the perceived value for the end user, which can lead to neglecting critical technical aspects like code quality, architecture, or performance.
    Impact: This can result in long-term technical issues, such as technical debt.

Difficulty Measuring Success

    Problem: User stories may lack clear metrics to measure their success or whether they actually delivered value.
    Impact: This makes it hard to evaluate if the delivered functionality meets objectives.

Challenges with Divisibility

    Problem: Breaking down large stories (epics) into smaller ones can be challenging and may lead to fragments that don’t provide value individually.
    Impact: This can disrupt the workflow and produce deliverables that are not useful on their own.

Risk of Being Too Generic

    Problem: Some user stories may be written so generically that they lose context, leaving the team without a clear vision of the problem being solved.
    Impact: This can cause demotivation or work disconnected from the user’s real needs.

Biased Prioritization

    Problem: If the Product Owner prioritizes user stories based on opinions or external pressures instead of concrete data, it may lead to poor prioritization.
    Impact: Features that are unnecessary or provide little value may be developed.

Lack of Inclusion of Technical Stakeholders

    Problem: In some teams, user stories focus so much on the end user that they fail to adequately include the needs of the technical team.
    Impact: This can cause resistance from the technical team or lead to suboptimal solutions being implemented.

### 4. Strategies to get habits to create context to get fit 

 1. Cue: the cues could be, time based, location based, visual triggers like place workout gear, or running shoes in a visible spot to remind yourself to exercise.

2. Craving: (visualize success) keep images, quotes, or reminders of your fitness goals in visible places to keep your motivation alive.

3. Response: (Start Small) Begin with an achievable action, like 5 minutes of stretching or a 10-minute walk. Make the barrier to entry low. 

4. Reward: (Intrinsic Rewards) Focus on the way exercise makes you feel—stronger, more confident, or less stressed.
